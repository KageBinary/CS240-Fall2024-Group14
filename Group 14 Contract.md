Group 14 Contract \- Mountain Lion Detection SDS

**Ground Rules:**

* Regular communication is required (Group chat)  
* Decisions should be agreed on, especially the final submission.  
* Work split evenly between members (doesn’t have to be all individual)  
* We share with the group if we are unable to complete our designated tasks  
* Speak up  
* Do work.  
* Hold each other accountable

**Don’ts**

* I’ve had group members not do anything → check in on each other’s work  
* Members have not responded to communication over media → check group chat frequently  
* Members have aimed lower which leads to lower grades → aim high so if we fall short it isn’t an issue

**Communication**

* The group will communicate via Discord or another chatting platform if later agreed upon  
* The group will meet virtually if necessary.

**Motto**

* DETECT TO PROTECT
